# Role Playing Game

## This game replicates the engine for those role playing games you see on ads all the time

### The goal of this project is to work on

- Object Destructuring
- Array Methods and Constructors
- Method Chaining
- Constructor Functions
- Modular Programming
- Timeout Function
- Classes
- Vanilla JS

### Why?

I decided to do this project because after learning React, I realized I have neglected some fundamentals such as classes since React now has functional components and hooks. I want to be a great asset to my team, so just because I don't need to use class components in React, it doesn't mean I don't need to understand classes. I also ran into trouble creating a Battleship game, so I think this will be a nice stepping stone to that.
